In this I am solving pattern questions
Now I know patterns are created in the form of Matrix and
 Rows represent outer loop
 Column represent inner loop

 Today I learned about pattern problems
 Half Pyramid,Inverted Half Pyramid,Half Pyramid with numbers, Inverted Half Pyramid rotated,
 Hollow rectangle, Floyd's Triangle, 0-1 triangle and Inverted Half Pyramid with numbers.

 It was a good day learned more about how I can build logic on program in different scenarios.
 That's all for Today, Mata Ashitha...
