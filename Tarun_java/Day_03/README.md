Today I wrote a program to reverse a number using while loop. 
Where I learned, we have iterate the loop till number becomes zero, 
For that inside loop we get remainder of the number 
Then multiply that number with reverse which is initially declared as 0 and then add the remainder.
At last before reiteratin the loop we divide the number by 10.
And this loop iterates until the number becomes 0.
Finally the reversed number will be stored in 'rev'.
